I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu) in August 2019 and am currently working as a freelancer out of Vienna, Austria. At Colorado, I was working in the Networking and Security Research Group led by Professor [Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io/). I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Vienna, Austria],(http://www.univie.ac.at) advised by Professor [Kurt Tutschku](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aXFXhGsAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2013 and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Professor Eric Keller in 2015. During my undergraduate studies, I spent one year at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu), working with Professor [Brighten Godfrey](http://pbg.cs.illinois.edu). My research interests span most areas of Computer Networking, and in particular, packet-level network monitoring, programmable data planes, and low-latency networking. I previously worked as a Backend Software Engineer at [TourRadar](http://www.tourradar.com), as a Mobile Software Engineer at [Tupalo](http://www.tupalo.com), and interned as a WAN Automation Engineer at [Juniper Networks](http://www.juniper.net).

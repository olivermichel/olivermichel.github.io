I am a postdoctoral research associate at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) working with Professor [Jennifer Rexford](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/).
Before joining Princeton, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at) working with Professor [Stefan Schmid](https://schmiste.github.io). 
I received a Ph.D. and M.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) advised by Professor [Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io/) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at).
During my undergraduate studies, I spent one year at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu), working with Professor [Brighten Godfrey](http://pbg.cs.illinois.edu).
Previously, I also worked as a software engineer at [Tupalo.com](https://www.tupalo.com) and [Tourradar.com](https://www.tourradar.com) and interned as a WAN Automation engineer at [Juniper Networks](https://www.juniper.net).
My research focuses on hardware support for real-time video conferencing applications, scalable packet-level network monitoring, programmable data planes, and high-performance networking architectures. My research statement (from Feb. 2021) is available [here](../doc/research-statement-om-feb21.pdf) and my CV is available [here](../doc/cv-academic.pdf).

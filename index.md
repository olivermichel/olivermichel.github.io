Before joining Princeton, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at) working with Professor [Stefan Schmid](https://schmiste.github.io). 
I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu) advised by Professor [Eric Keller](https://eric-keller.github.io/).
My research interests are broadly in networking and network measurement, with a focus on real-time multimedia applications, programmable data planes, and wireless networks.

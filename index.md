I am a fourth-year doctoral student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Here, I am working in the Networking and Security Research Group (NSR) advised by Professor Eric Keller. I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Vienna, Austria advised by Professor Kurt Tutschku in 2013 and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Professor Eric Keller in 2015. During my undergraduate studies, I spent one year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working with Professor Brighten Godfrey. My research interests span most areas of Computer Networking, and in particular, software-defined wide-area networking, network management abstractions, programmable data planes, and low-latency networking. I worked as an iOS Software Engineer for two years at Tupalo.com in Vienna, Austria and recently interned as a WAN Automation Engineer at Juniper Networks.

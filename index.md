I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Colorado Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu). Here, I am working in the [Networking and Security Research Group (NSR)](http://nsr.colorado.edu) advised by Professor [Eric Keller](http://ngn.cs.colorado.edu/~ekeller/). I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Vienna, Austria](http://www.univie.ac.at) advised by Professor [Kurt Tutschku](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aXFXhGsAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2013 and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder advised by Professor Eric Keller in 2015. During my undergraduate studies, I spent one year at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu) working with Professor [Brighten Godfrey](http://pbg.cs.illinois.edu). My research interests span most areas of Computer Networking, and in particular, software-defined wide-area networking, network management abstractions, programmable data planes, and low-latency networking. I worked as an iOS Software Engineer for two years at [Tupalo.com](http://www.tupalo.com) in Vienna, Austria and recently interned as a WAN Automation Engineer at [Juniper Networks](http://www.juniper.net).
